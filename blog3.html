        <small>07th June, 2021</small>

        <p>
            The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to live most of their lives, including work,
            entertainment, and personal interactions, online. All this screen time has taken a toll, as more people of
            all ages are reporting symptoms of "cybersickness."Cybersickness was a phenomenon before the pandemic, but
            had been studied mostly in the context of up-and-coming virtual reality games. Cybersickness is a form of
            motion sickness, characterized by nausea, disorientation, and oculomotor disturbances, according to a study
            of the problem by Kay Stanney and colleagues, published in 2020 in the International Journal of
            Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
        <p>A recent article in National Geographic explains how cybersickness is seasickness in reverse. Instead of your
            body moving while your perception thinks you should be still, such as the experience of being on a boat
            while looking at a fixed horizon. In a virtual world your body is still, but your senses are perceiving
            motion, whether through video games, zoom meetings, or just endless scrolling.Fortunately, the dizziness and
            discomfort of too much screen time can be eased by some of the same strategies that work on other types of
            motion sickness.For example, the Sea-Band wristband is designed to relieve the symptoms of motion and travel
            sickness naturally through the use of acupressure. Specifically, the Sea-Bands include studs sewn inside
            that put gentle, steady pressure on the P6 (Nei-Kuan) acupressure point. Studies have shown that applying
            pressure to this point relieves the nausea associated with motion sickness."Because the bands do not use
            drugs, they do not cause any of the side effects associated with anti-nausea drugs and can be worn on each
            wrist whenever you feel nauseous," according to the company website.</p>
        <p>Sea-Band wristbands can be used by anyone, adults or children, and usually have an effect on symptoms within
            five minutes of putting one on, according to the company. Sea-Bands are latex-free, washable, and reusable,
            and they can be used in combination with other anti-nausea medications.Sea-Bands can help relieve not only
            the nausea and dizziness associated with motion sickness and cybersickness, but also post-surgery nausea,
            nausea associated with chemotherapy, and nausea associated with pregnancy. And Sea-Band products are HSA-
            and FSA-approved, so they are covered by many health insurance plans.For more information, visit
