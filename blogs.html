                <p>With school back in session, now is a good time for college students to consider their potential
                    career options.Unfortunately, many students know little about the financial planning profession.
                    This includes being unfamiliar with what financial planners do, the variety of career opportunities
                    available, the skillsets that are helpful in the profession and how the career can be personally
                    rewarding.</p>

                <p>The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to live most of their lives, including work,
                    entertainment, and personal interactions, online. All this screen time has taken a toll, as more
                    people
                    of all ages are reporting symptoms of "cybersickness.</p>

                <p>Cooling towers, a key component on large buildings, require special levels of cleaning to control
                    biocontaminants including Legionella, heterotrophic bacteria, and others. However, poorly maintained
                    towers, which are often treated with corrosive chemicals, can become ‘super spreaders’ of
                    Legionnaires’ Disease, an acute bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract that is not rare
                    and causes severe pneumonia.</p>

                <small>04th September, 2021</small>
                <p>Despite challenges over the past year, more than half of U.S. adults are optimistic about the next
                    six to 18 months, according to two nationwide surveys commissioned by the Contact Lens Institute.
                    That translates to people planning to socialize more and concentrate more on health — including
                    eyesight."America is once again focused on the future. Great vision and contact lens options play a
                    huge role in turning plans into reality.</p>
