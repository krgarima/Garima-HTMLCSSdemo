                <p>Abbreviated from decentralized financing, DeFi is the overarching concept for various public space
                    applications and projects in blockchain that aim to disrupt the traditional financial world. Uniswap is a decentralized sector that will dominate the DeFi network. The UNI token was launched in
                    September 2020 by the UNISVAP protocol. It is one of the leading products in the industry with a growth rate
                    of up to 1100% in the same range.</p>

                <p>The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to live most of their lives, including work,
                    entertainment, and personal interactions, online. All this screen time has taken a toll, as more
                    people
                    of all ages are reporting symptoms of "cybersickness.</p>

                <p>Cooling towers, a key component on large buildings, require special levels of cleaning to control
                    biocontaminants including Legionella, heterotrophic bacteria, and others. However, poorly maintained
                    towers, which are often treated with corrosive chemicals, can become ‘super spreaders’ of
                    Legionnaires’ Disease, an acute bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract that is not rare
                    and causes severe pneumonia.</p>

                <small>04th September, 2021</small>
                <p>Despite challenges over the past year, more than half of U.S. adults are optimistic about the next
                    six to 18 months, according to two nationwide surveys commissioned by the Contact Lens Institute.
                    That translates to people planning to socialize more and concentrate more on health — including
                    eyesight."America is once again focused on the future. Great vision and contact lens options play a
                    huge role in turning plans into reality.</p>
