        <p>
            Once a valid vulnerability has been reported by a security expert, the organization assesses it and pays the
            expert a fee. That's how it works.

            <h3>HackerOne -</h3>
            <div>HackerOne is without a doubt the world's largest ethical hacking community. Experts from almost all
                countries participate and collaborate on this platform. They host their bug bounty code on the largest
                companies.
                Hackers have earned more than $ 100 million in financial compensation for vulnerabilities and
                vulnerabilities in web applications. </div>
